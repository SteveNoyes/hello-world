<p> I'm not sure how I finally commited to learning code. I remember a guy sitting at my bar 6 or 7 years ago. His shirt had < > braces on it and something inside that I didn't understand. We talked about coding and I was interested but he said I would be better suited for UI stuff (I didn't understand that at the time) or web design. He said that coding was complex, then he crypticlly explained if/else statements and left me with that. </p>
